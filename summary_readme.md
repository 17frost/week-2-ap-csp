Overview

This week introduces students to fundamental Python concepts — how computers store and manipulate data, display information, and perform calculations. By the end, students will write their first creative program from scratch.

Here’s a clear **student summary** of what they’re learning this week based on your uploaded files (`1_variables_and_datatypes.py`, `2_working_with_strings.py`, `3_numbers_in_python.py`, `4_practice_prompts`, and `5_finalChallenge.py`):

##  **Week 2: Python Basics — Variables, Strings, Numbers & Your First Program**

### **Overview**

This week introduces students to **fundamental Python concepts** — how computers store and manipulate data, display information, and perform calculations. By the end, students will write their first creative program from scratch.

---

### **1. Algorithms & Variables**

Students learn that an **algorithm** is a step-by-step process for solving a problem. They’ll see how algorithms translate into **Python code**, starting with defining variables that store values (text, numbers, or logical states).
Key concepts:

* Algorithms: clear sequences of steps 
* Variables: containers that hold data (e.g., `name = "John"`, `age = 23`)
* Data types: strings, integers, floats, and booleans
* Naming rules: no spaces, can’t start with numbers, avoid reserved keywords

---

### **2. Working with Strings**

Students explore how Python handles text and learn basic **string operations** like joining, slicing, and formatting.
Key concepts:

* Concatenation: combining text (`"Hello" + "World"`)
* Functions: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.isupper()`, `len()`
* Indexing and slicing: accessing parts of a word (`phrase[1:4]`)
* Advanced string tools: `.split()`, `.format()`, and **f-strings** for readable outputs 

---

### **3. Numbers and Math in Python**

Students move from text to numerical data. They’ll perform **math operations** and use the **math library** for advanced calculations.
Key concepts:

* Integers and floats (`5`, `3.14`)
* Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `//`
* Built-in functions: `abs()`, `max()`, `min()`, `round()`
* Math library: `sqrt()`, `ceil()`, `floor()`
* Order of operations (PEMDAS) and combining math in code 

---

### **4. Practice Prompts**

Students practice writing and testing small programs using everything learned so far.
Examples:

* Creating short print statements
* Combining strings and variables
* Using operators in creative expressions

---

### **5. Final Challenge: Beer Name Generator**

The week ends with a **hands-on mini project** — students build an interactive program that uses user input to generate a creative beer name.
Key skills:

* Using `input()` to collect user responses
* Combining variables into a string
* Printing results with formatting and quotation marks 

---

### ** Learning Goals**

By the end of this week, students should be able to:
✅ Define and use variables effectively
✅ Differentiate between strings, integers, floats, and booleans
✅ Use string and math operations correctly
✅ Write, run, and debug small Python programs
✅ Build an interactive program using `print()` and `input()`
